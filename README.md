## Project Norms

### Plan first!
 - A plan is not a plan if it's not written down!
   - Be prepared to spend at 30-60 minutes planning out in detail (with illustrations) how you intend to accomplish your goal
 - After your plan, if you realize you need to change it up, address it in your plan and justify your decision, and any tradeoffs that you anticipate
 - Link your plan in you PR
 
### Take pains to keep things readable and orderly
  - Things should, generally, be organized either alphabetically or proximally to the things they are related to
  - Make an effort to name things as intuitively as possible, but also as robustly / future-proofed as possible (planning really helps with this)
     - use consistent verbage when doing for the same sorts of things
  - When writing any code, be thinking about the 'shape' of the code you're writing
     - be intentional to use Big characters and white-space (indentation, and break-lines especially, but also spaces) to create better scan-a-bility
     - soften up long stretches of code with a line-break where appropriate (I use a paragraph jumper to navigate, so this helps me jump around as well)
     - when calling functions or listing parameters, add a space between the opening and closing parenthesis i.e. `exampleFx( arg1, arg2 )`
     
### Testing is incredibly important, so be thinking about how to do so with the most coverage while you write. However,
   - Testing will be done in batches to prevent wasting time
   - Make sure to look ahead before writing any tests. If the code you're writing is unstable, hold off until it is less likely to change.
   - Once the tests are written, it is the responsibility of the code writer to ensure the tests are passing. So again, hold off until necessary
   
### High-quality Charts and Data Displays are premium!
   - Use illustrations to map out user flows whenever possible. Include important state changes!
   - Use charts to show Data-Structures and their underlying principles and help reason about them
   - Refer to them while coding to keep the larger context in the forefront of mind

### Code-review is one of the best ways to develop, both for code-reading skills, but also as an opportunity for feedback
   - Be bold. If you have questions, this an amazing forum for that
   - Be bold. If you have suggestions or feedback, provide it! Make sure to attempt a clear justification for your insight
   - Be encouraging! If things are amazing, or awesome or cool, give a shout-out to what you like
   - Peer-review is not mandatory, but try to make an effort to seek them out / offer them
   
## Git-Flow

### Create a Feature Branch for each milestone.
   - This will be a quazi-master branch. 
   - Small improvements or enhancements will be merged into the feature branch. 
   - When the milestone is complete or the code is at a stable point, we will merge it into main.
   - Link the corresponding issues into the pull-requests.
